# Spite Project Badges

A badge system to celebrate the unique circumstances and characteristics of spite projects. Because if you're going to build something out of spite, you might as well flex about it.

## Available Badges

### Speed Run
**ID:** `speed-run`
**Emoji:** 🏃
**Criteria:** First commit to production deployment in under 24 hours
**Why it matters:** Because sometimes the best response to "that would take months" is "hold my coffee"

### One Coffee Build
**ID:** `one-coffee`
**Emoji:** ☕
**Criteria:** Entire project built during a single coffee session
**Why it matters:** Peak productivity meets peak caffeine. Usually happens around 2pm when you're avoiding real work.

### Rage Quit Result
**ID:** `rage-quit`
**Emoji:** 💢
**Criteria:** Built immediately after rage-quitting something frustrating
**Why it matters:** The most powerful motivator is someone telling you "we can't do that." Watch me.

### 3am Spite
**ID:** `3am-spite`
**Emoji:** 🌙
**Criteria:** Primary development commits occurred between 2-5am
**Why it matters:** The hours when spite meets insomnia. Your best/worst decisions happen here.

### Full Circle
**ID:** `full-circle`
**Emoji:** 🔄
**Criteria:** Replaced something that replaced something you originally built
**Why it matters:** "You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me."

### Surgical Strike
**ID:** `surgical-strike`
**Emoji:** 🎯
**Criteria:** Accomplished its goal in under 100 lines of code
**Why it matters:** Because bloat is a choice, and you chose violence.

### Mammoth Slayer
**ID:** `mammoth-slayer`
**Emoji:** 🦣
**Criteria:** Successfully replaced enterprise software
**Why it matters:** David vs Goliath, but Goliath costs $50k/year in licensing fees.

### Vibe Coded
**ID:** `vibe-coded`
**Emoji:** 🎨
**Criteria:** Built primarily with AI assistance (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
**Why it matters:** Embracing the new paradigm. The AI understood the assignment.

### Subscription Killer
**ID:** `subscription-killer`
**Emoji:** 💸
**Criteria:** Replaces a paid SaaS product
**Why it matters:** $9/month adds up. Your spite just saved someone $108/year.

### First Blood
**ID:** `first-blood`
**Emoji:** 🏴
**Criteria:** One of the first 100 spite projects listed on spiteprojects.com
**Why it matters:** Early adopter of petty excellence. You were here when spite was still underground.
